# themis-api
Themis doesn't really offer an API, but here is some documentation anyway 

`{{ _.base_url }}` is just a placeholder for `https://themis.housing.rug.nl/`

`{{ _.year_url }}` is a placeholder for the year it extracted from the "GET course" call, which is as of writing this equal to `/2020-2021`
